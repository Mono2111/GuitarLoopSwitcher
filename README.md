Hello! 

It's just a guitar effect pedal that allows you to combine multiple guitar effects into one preset. Currently it supports two "preset base stages" with the possibility to store two presets on one switch. Also sends a midi signal to other effects. This code is executed on an old teensy. Still running on my pedal board.
